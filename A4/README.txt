of decision tree
(2)for question 2:
using following command:
"python dt2.py"
It will show the plot of accuracy respect max_depth = 1~10(both
of train and validation)
It will print the .dot file of the best max_depth decision tree
(3)for question 3:
PLEASE make sure run the following command with "dt3.py",
"set_a.csv" and "set_b.csv" in same folder
